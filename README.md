# Deal Steelers

Deal Steelers is an innovative application designed to maximize the use of gift cards by reminding users of their unused gift cards when they are near a relevant store. This solution taps into the vast potential of the burgeoning gift card market, valued at $899.3 billion and projected to reach $2.3 trillion by 2030.
